# planetjs EXPANDED


🪐 A tiny JavaScript experiment to render a beautiful 3D planet right in your browser — with clouds, night lights, and a bit of galactic flair. 🌌


🚀 What is this?
planetjs is a lightweight interactive WebGL demo (using Three.js behind the scenes) that visualizes a spinning planet with:

- 🌍 Day texture

- 🌑 Night lights

- ☁️  Cloud layers

- 🗻 Displacement map terrain

- 🌠 Starry background

Think of it as your personal Earth(ish) screensaver... in the browser.

🛠️ Getting Started
Clone this planet into your local system:

	git clone https://github.com/an-dr32/planetjs.git
	cd planetjs
	
Then just open the index.html in your browser!

	open index.html   # macOS
	# or
	start index.html  # Windows
	
🚫 No build steps. No dependencies. Just HTML, JS, and space magic.

🧠 How it works
This is a basic Three.js scene made of:

- A sphere geometry

- Several layered textures:

	- image.jpg for the day surface

	- nightlights.png for the glowing cities

	- clouds.png as a semi-transparent overlay

	- displacement-map.jpg to simulate terrain bumps

- An orbiting light and camera

- Starfield background for ambience

✨ Features
- Realtime rendering

- Simple, clean codebase

- Easily extensible

- Runs locally in any modern browser

- Zero dependencies (unless you want to add some!)

📸 Screenshots
Coming soon... or try it yourself, it's prettier live anyway! 🌐
